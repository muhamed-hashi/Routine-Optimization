            <h2>Problem Description</h2>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>We aim to create a website that assists users in tracking habits, with the ultimate goal of fostering healthier routines
                and habits. In a time when distractions are ubiquitous, even a simple notification on your phone can lead to endless hours
                of scrolling or media consumption. As noted, “Our smartphones, the smartest 21st-century innovation in humanity, can be the
                biggest distraction of the present age.” [1] By building intuitive resources, such as a website for habit tracking, we offer
                users a space to monitor their needs. This can help users take accountability for their actions, build satisfying routines,
                reduce distractions, and overall improve their everyday lives.</p>
            <h3>Information Problems</h3>
            <p>A key information technology issue in this space involves the personalization of data relating to the user. Habit tracking
                is not a one-size-fits-all solution. Another issue is ensuring accountability in habit-building applications. To effectively
                support users in building habits, the application needs to be user-friendly and incorporate features that keep users consistently
                engaged. The challenge lies in balancing ease of use with the necessary functionality to support diverse user needs.</p>
            <h3>Other Attempts</h3>
            <p>There are many examples of productivity-assisting resources available. One notable example is Habitica, “a free habit-building
                and productivity app that treats your real life like a game” [2]. Habitica uses gamification, incorporating rewards and punishments,
                to motivate users to build and maintain healthy habits. This approach adds an element of fun and engagement to the process of habit
                tracking, making it a unique and interesting solution in the space of productivity apps.</p>
